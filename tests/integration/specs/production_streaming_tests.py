"""Production Streaming Test Implementation.

This module contains actual tests that validate the refactored architecture
works correctly using the exact same execution paths as production.

CRITICAL CORRECTIONS:
1. All tests MUST use StreamCoordinator.coordinate_stream_execution() (not flow.stream directly)
2. All tests MUST validate state sync pattern from VirtualAgoraV13Flow.stream():841
3. All tests MUST verify GraphInterrupt propagation through V13NodeWrapper
4. All tests MUST monitor performance and memory usage

CRITICAL: These tests now catch the actual production issues by using corrected patterns.
