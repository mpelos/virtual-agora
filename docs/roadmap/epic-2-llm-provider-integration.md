# Epic 2: LLM Provider Integration Layer

## Epic Overview
Create a unified abstraction layer for integrating multiple LLM providers (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok) with consistent interfaces and error handling.

## Technical Context
- **Framework:** LangChain for LLM integration
- **Providers:** Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok
- **Key Pattern:** Factory pattern for provider instantiation
- **Error Handling:** Provider-specific retry logic

---

### Story 2.7: Unified Error Handling and Retry Logic
**As a** system  
**I want** robust error handling across all providers  
**So that** temporary failures don't disrupt the session

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement provider-agnostic error classification
- Create retry logic with exponential backoff
- Handle rate limiting across all providers
- Log all API errors appropriately
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- Provide fallback behavior for failed agents

**Technical Notes:**
