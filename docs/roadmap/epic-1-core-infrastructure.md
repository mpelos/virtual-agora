# Epic 1: Core Infrastructure & Configuration Management

## Epic Overview

Establish the foundational infrastructure for the Virtual Agora application, including configuration management, environment setup, and logging capabilities.

## Technical Context

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Configuration Format:** YAML (using PyYAML)
- **Core Framework:** LangGraph for stateful graph management
- **Environment Management:** python-dotenv for API keys

---

## User Stories

### Story 1.1: Project Structure Setup

**As a** developer
**I want** a well-organized project structure
**So that** the codebase is maintainable and scalable

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Python project structure follows best practices
- Main application entry point is clearly defined
- Separate directories for:
  - Core application logic
  - Agent implementations
  - Configuration utilities
  - Tests
  - Documentation
  - Generated reports output directory
- .gitignore file configured for Python projects
- Requirements.txt file with all dependencies

**Technical Notes:**

- Use Python 3.10+ features
- Include type hints throughout the codebase

---

### Story 1.2: Configuration File Parser

**As a** system administrator
**I want** to configure the Virtual Agora through a YAML file
**So that** I can easily set up different agent configurations

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Parse config.yml file using PyYAML
- Validate configuration structure on load
- Support moderator configuration with provider and model fields
- Support agents list with provider, model, and count fields
- Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Create configuration schema documentation

**Technical Notes:**

- Example configuration provided in project spec (section 6)
- Configuration should be loaded once at startup
- Consider using Pydantic for configuration validation

---

### Story 1.3: Environment Variable Management

**As a** developer
**I want** secure API key management
**So that** credentials are not exposed in the codebase

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Load API keys from .env file using python-dotenv
- Support keys for all providers:
  - GOOGLE_API_KEY
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - GROK_API_KEY
- Validate all required keys are present at startup
- Provide informative error messages for missing keys
- Include .env.example file with key structure

**Technical Notes:**

- Application should fail gracefully if keys are missing
- Never log API keys

---

### Story 1.4: Logging Infrastructure

**As a** user
**I want** comprehensive session logging
**So that** I can review and analyze past discussions

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Create timestamped log file for each session (e.g., session_2025-07-25_121500.log)
- Log all agent interactions with timestamps
- Log all user inputs and system decisions
- Implement different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Ensure logs are human-readable
- Store logs in a dedicated directory

**Technical Notes:**

- Use Python's logging module
- Consider rotating logs if they become too large
- Include speaker identification in each log entry

---

### Story 1.5: Application State Management Foundation

**As a** developer
**I want** a robust state management system
**So that** the application can track complex multi-phase workflows

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Design state schema for LangGraph integration
- Define state structure for:
  - Current phase
  - Active topic
  - Agent list and turn order
  - Discussion history
  - Voting records
  - Generated summaries
- Implement state initialization
- Create state transition validators

**Technical Notes:**

- State should be serializable for potential save/load functionality
- Use Python dataclasses or Pydantic models for state definition

---

### Story 1.6: Error Handling Framework

**As a** user
**I want** the application to handle errors gracefully
**So that** a single failure doesn't crash the entire session

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Implement global exception handling
- Create custom exception classes for different error types
- Log all errors with full context
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures

**Technical Notes:**

- Consider implementing retry logic for transient failures
- Maintain application state consistency during error recovery

---

## Dependencies

- None (this is the foundational epic)

## Definition of Done

- All stories completed and tested
- Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- All public functions have docstrings
- Unit tests achieve >80% coverage
- Configuration documentation is complete
- Logging produces useful output for debugging
